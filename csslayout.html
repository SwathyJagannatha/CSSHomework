<!--Task 1: Create a Basic Flexbox Layout Start by creating a simple webpage layout using Flexbox. Your layout should include a header, a navigation menu, a main content area, and a footer. Utilize flex-direction to make sure your navigation menu is reading horizontally and your main content is reading vertically. Requirements for this task:

Navigation Menu should contain at least 3 things (i.e. Home, Profile, About) and be arranged horizontally on the top of the page
Header section should contain a background image and header text
Header Text should be bold, contrast color and Centered

Main Content should contain at least 2 different children divs with content and be arranged vertically stacked on top of one another
Footer should contain at least 3 sections (i.e. Contact Us, Events, Blog) and be arranged horizontally 
Expected Outcome: A webpage with a basic Flexbox layout, displaying a header, navigation, main content, and footer in a columnar arrangement

Task 2: Implement Responsive Design Modify your Flexbox layout to include responsive design elements. Use media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens, converting the navigation and footer content areas into a column format when the viewport width is less than 600px.

Task 3: Enhance the Layout with Flexbox Properties Further enhance your layout by using Flexbox properties such as justify-content, align-items, and flex-grow. Adjust these properties to ensure that the main content area takes up the remaining space between the header and footer, and centers the content within the navigation and main content areas.

        <h1><b> Welcome to the CSS Layout Design Page</b></h1>
        <p>A cupcake (AmE), fairy cake (BrE), or bun (IrE) is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a small thin paper or aluminum cup. <span style="font-weight:bold;">As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied.</span></p>
        <p>A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to bake cupcakes. The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other ingredients stirred in, such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate chips.</p>
